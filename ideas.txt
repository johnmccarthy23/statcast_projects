launch_hit - done

pitcher_cluster - done (could use a lil)
    - choose various meaningful pitching metrics and cluster pitchers together
    to hopefully see a trend in bad, solid, good, great pitchers

visualize_pitch
    - try to visualize (maybe animate) a pitch using release point, break, (maybe velo), and where it crosses the plate

simulate_ab
    - give a model previous data on a selected pitcher and hitter.
    - model should take in how other pitchers pitch to hitter and how pitcher pitches
    - try to visualize pitch sequence
    - should show what outcome would be
    - maybe it would help strategize against opponent

hit_spray
    - choose a batter
    - show a gradient of where he hits the ball in play
    - maybe a mark that shows hit velo

events_by_inning
    - see the distributions of home runs, strikeouts, walks per inning

abs_effect
    - analyze how the new abs system for 2026 will affect players
    - see the close calls that umpires missed on players
    - show the luckiest/unluckiest players from 2025

betting_setters
    - create lines for an upcoming game (what goes into that?)
    - make an algorithm that bets for you. What is most lucrative and safe?
